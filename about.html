    <h1>A Little About Me...</h1>
    <p>I care about a lot of things, material or conceptual, and damn near everyone I meet (though I may not show it). Some of these “things” include but are not limited to love, comfort, laughter, music, movies, video games, what makes others happy, what makes them tick, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I stand for entertainment for entertainment’s sake. Like most, I think life is too short to not focus on the things that fill you with awe or curiosity. If I'm not like, “That’s cool, how can I do that?” chances are it might be hard for me to give something much attention. You could say I stand for those with little to no attention spans.</p>
