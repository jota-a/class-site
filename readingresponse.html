  <h1>a response to Ursula K. Le Guin's,<a href="http://ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html">A Rant on Technology</a></h1>
  <p>things i found interesting:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    -you can't really describe a space in time without mentioning technology in some form; whether that’s how advanced it has become, or the lack thereof
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    -“technology is how society copes with physical reality” or how efficiently we can complete the tasks we set out to do

    -something being “hi” or “low” tech is entirely subjective; those who discovered “low” tech probably thought it was “hi” at the moment of discovery
